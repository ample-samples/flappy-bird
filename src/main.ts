 * MVP:
 * 1. The bird will be controlled with a key and move up and down on the screen
 * 2. Obstacles of varying heights will travel from right to left
 * 3. The game ends when the bird touches an obstacle
 *
 * === # Psuedocode ===
 *
 * Typescript will be used for:
 * - Creating objects
 * - Holding state
 * - Taking keyboard inputs from the user
 * - Detecting events, i.e. collisions and scoring
 * - Moving objects, i.e. the bird and the obstacles
 *
 *
 * Code structure:
 * 1. Setup functions
 *   - Game state
 *   - Object creation
 * 2. Game loop
 *   - Each loop will have a set time interval
 *   - Game logic happens here
 *
 * File structure:
 * main.ts - contains main game loop
 * setup.ts - initialises game objects
 * utils.ts - utility functions
